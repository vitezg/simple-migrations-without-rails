Simple example for using ActiveRecord migrations without Rails.
Adapt for your own needs!

standalone_table_creation.rb can create a DB table with ActiveRecord without
the other files, while the rest of the code demonstrates versioned
migrations.

To migrate the database, create the appropriate file in migrations, and run
ruby migratedb.rb [version_to_migrate_to]

[version_to_migrate_to] is optional, and defaults to the highest version.
